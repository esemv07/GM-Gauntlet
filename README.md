 [Name WIP] A wearable glove-style dice roller.
</div>

## Description

This project is a glove style wearable that acts as a dice roller. Each finger will have a conductive pad that, when touched by the thumb, will trigger a different dice selection.
When a die is selected, shaking the hand will trigger the rolling of the dice, generating a random roll result on the LCD screen.
